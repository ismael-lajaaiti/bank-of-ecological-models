# The bank

This repository aggregates scripts reproducing either results
from an ecology paper that piqued our interest or a famous ecological model.

## How it is stored?

Each paper or model has its dedicated folder that contains *at least*:
1) a script that runs the simulations and produces a figure
2) the figure generated by the script

We list below to which paper or model corresponds each folder:

- `gravel_2015_stability-complexity-metaecosystems`: [Gravel et al. 2015, Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12457/)
